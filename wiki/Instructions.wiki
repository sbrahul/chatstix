===Compiling===

The source files are located in the _src_ folder while the header files are in the _include_ folder.
If _gcc_ is used to compile the code, then the command is:
{{{
gcc *.c -lpthread -o srv
}}}
The project uses pthread libraries which have to be specified during compiliation.
_srv_ is the output file.

Same goes for the client,
{{{
gcc *.c -lpthread -o cli
}}}

(These commands have to be executed inside the _src_ folder. If executing from outside, then the appropriate directory has to be specified)

===Executing===

Executing the server is very simple as no arguments are required. The following is for executing from the src folder.
{{{
./srv
}}}
 
The client on the other hand takes a single argument which is the IP(v4) address of the server.
{{{
./cli 192.168.1.10
}}}
(where 192.168.1.10 is the machine running the server)
